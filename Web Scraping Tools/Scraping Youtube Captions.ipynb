Winston Churchill said once you know sir oh I wish I had a lemon with my gin and tonic the next day they found a lemon tree [Music] the journey was torment for the sick Roosevelt his polio and the strains of war leadership dragged him down in the former czars palace the leaders faced a heavy agenda they must decide how to govern a defeated Germany and they wanted to get the Polish question settled Eastern Europe important date was with only one of many other things first of all winning the war and then occupying Germany seconds is seeing to the war against Japan thirdly the post-war arrangements Stalin knew that the war was won after all the Russians were only 40 miles from Berlin at that time they were on the point of capturing Eastern Europe not a whole lot yet he was a very shrewd negotiator sort of smoking he said he was a chain smoker and he was a sort of smoking and listening you know then all is that he would raise his fingers ah a terrible mistake the Roosevelt made was that he was trying to ingratiate himself into divisions between Churchill and himself so he made it quite clear to Stalin that there were real divisions as well as imaginary ones for us of course the major topic was the future of Eastern Europe and above all Thurmond and on that Stalin obviously with boundary get what he wanted which was the Red Army which in occupation of the whole area including Poland had already gone through Poland into Germany by the time we were in Yalta by now the Balkans and most of Poland were in Soviet hands so too was much of Czechoslovakia and Hungary battlefield facts that diplomacy could not alter we got a doubter to diplomatic documents which on paper well perfectly satisfactory I mean that there would be a coalition government in Poland including people from the west and there would be free elections in Poland and then there was a declaration covering the whole of Eastern Europe called the declaration on liberated Europe which again was to be rebuilt on the basis of democracy and free elections and all the rest of it was phrases which the Russian used but interpreted rather differently [Music] Stalin promised that the Polish elections would be free and fair tired of arguing the others took him at his word Germany would be governed jointly by the victorious Allies and Stalin secretly pledged to join the war against Japan Churchill was confident we are well bound ourselves to work together to make sure that there is increasing happiness and prosperity for the broad message of the people in every land no longer subject to the hard strains of war there is the prospect which has now opened before us funeral special heads for Washington an honor guard of servicemen keeps vigil beside the flag draped casket at villages crossroads waystations the people who were so close to his heart stands silently expressive of the devotion Franklin Roosevelt inspired [Music] as the president was buried the last battles in Europe were ending American troops were taking over German towns without resistance they were glad to see the American troops because they had a terrible fear of having Russians occupy or come into their their area as the Allies advanced they discovered the full horror of German crimes [Music] the Jews had been the Nazis special target that every nation was mourning over mass graves fear of a German revival would overshadow the first years of peace soon Soviet and American troops would meet in Germany our lieutenant came in one day and said he got up he going to go and see if we can find some Russians well none of us were too eager to go on that Patrol really because we realized the end of the war was imminent and we had gotten this far why stick our necks out again we kept going and we kept running into no resistance and everybody was retiring and and lucky we got to the Elbe River and we saw the Russians on the other side oh yeah it was get down - I was a whisker to me I told my girlfriend you stand been waiting for them to come ashore you would go there at what boil you could see their faces they look like ordinary people we even imagined something different yeah they were Americans owe me regardless of the key what I guess we Russians but when you looked at them and you know you put an American uniform on and they could have been American miss Malick are also going to worry we we were just kissing everyone absolutely yeah do Moscow know I think that for us the war was over now according to what we washed our feet in the Elbe River we washed our faces and hands we thought in regard to me the war must be over two days later the movie cameras were ready the moment of history the meeting of ordinary soldiers from Russia and America was rerun dramatically with a bigger cast by Allied agreement the capture of Berlin was left to the Russians April 1945 the Red Army launches its final offensive towards Berlin the war cost the Soviet Union 27 million lives nearly 40 times American and British losses put together the red flag guessed him to fly over the billion scratches kick my door give risk we use tablecloths that one night I helped my friend the Jewish tailor sewed them into three flags a flag we took them to Berlin mushroom Turks are bad I found three soldiers and we climbed up Catania the first photograph I took was of the flag I brought from Moscow hundreds gathered in San Francisco to found the United Nations Organization the Soviet delegation was led by the man who had signed the nazi-soviet pact Molotov multiple watching of me on an asteroid Molotov was very nervous just because he felt that the war is coming to an end what victory would soon be here and here he is in America to get the Lemmy you sent cables to Stalin now a stallion the massacre damnably when may I return as the San Francisco surrender General Eisenhower informs me that the forces of Germany have surrendered to the United Nations the flags of freedom fly all over Europe as the fighting stopped the Soviet frontline had cut Europe into from the Baltic to the Adriatic the war in the Pacific dragged on American marines had stormed Iwo Jima it was a foretaste of how difficult and bloody the final invasion of Japan might be [Music] Potsdam in Concord Germany site of the third allied summit the attitude in Washington toward the Soviet Union had begun to change well before Potsdam storm signals were already flying the Romanovs guild Akoya of its l Nazarian Truman declared officially and quite sharply but the Declaration on Europe adopted at Yalta is not being carried out in some countries Couture Ebola primitive Samia Crimbo knockin Syrian same stuff just mascara extraños governments are being said I which the United States will not recognize Kotori the Potsdam Conference a bad-tempered conference because apart from the ceremonial occasions it was really very agree about a German peace treaty or on how to carry out agreements reached at yalta Stalin confirmed that his troops were ready for war with Japan but the day before the conference America had successfully tested an atomic bomb President Truman after consulting with the British and with his own military advisers decided that he would tell Stalin that we had a powerful new weapon without identifying it as a nuclear weapon that Thurmond dr. pellis beastly said the Truman repeated what he was saying about the new weapon he thought him Stalin said okay thank you for the information there was some question amongst the Americans as to whether Stalin had really understood what Truman was saying as we now know they knew all about the Manhattan Project through espionage in their own agents with the conference still in session news arrived from London that Clement Attlee had been elected British Prime Minister a near Pakistan abortion set seed last that I had a feeling that the biggest sensation for Molitor from Stalin was not the bomb explosion but the fact that Churchill was not re-elected in England enough another photo call the world must see that the Allies were still united on August the second the conference ended and the Statesman went home four days later America dropped an atomic bomb on the city and people of Hiroshima three days after that another was dropped on Nagasaki soon the human race would be able to destroy itself in a day at each Cold War crisis to come the nuclear shadow threatened [Music] [Applause] [Music]\n","42\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import pandas as pd\n","filename=\"\"\n","Docu_Tag=[\"Documentary\"]*len(DOCUMENTARYLIST)\n","print(len(DOCUMENTARYLIST))\n","df = pd.DataFrame(list(zip(Docu_Tag, DOCUMENTARYLIST,LINKSWORKED)),columns =['Genre', 'Text','Link'])\n","df.to_csv(filename)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"z11v5ByC7saJ","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1711466966407,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":723,"user":{"displayName":"H.Z.
