This is the full kNN-vc notebook. 

The audio files cannot be made available due to excessive file size. However, a zipped folder of the pytorch tensors for each of the genres and genders is available here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_tdDoi-T9gEAs6le782EVcKgAvoRoWxV/view?usp=sharing which can be opened in the notebook file and set to the matching_set parameter inside of the out_wav call.
